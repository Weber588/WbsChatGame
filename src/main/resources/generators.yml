# ==================================================================================================================== #
# In this file, you can configure the specifics about how word generators work, by manually adding or removing words to
# each category.
#
# The categories are pre-configured, as they generate from code itself, and you cannot add new ones.
#
# As some generators can't filter properly (since it's somewhat arbitrary and the game doesn't know details),
# some generators are preconfigured to remove & add certain corrections, such as removing technical blocks that
# aren't fun to guess. You can edit those here if you want to include it, or remove more that were missed.

# The 'animals' section has commented out examples of how to configure the generators. Remember to remove {}
# when adding sections to configure a generator.
# ==================================================================================================================== #

animal: {} # Remove the {} when uncommenting any of the below
  # ignore-exact will prevent the exact terms listed from being generated (case insensitive). For example,
  # 'Horse' will prevent only 'Horse' from being generated, but 'Skeleton Horse' and 'Zombie Horse' can still generate.
#  ignore-exact:
#    - 'Horse'

  # ignore-contains will prevent any terms containing terms listed from being generated. For example,
  # 'Horse' will prevent 'Horse', 'Skeleton Horse', and 'Zombie Horse' from being generated.
#  ignore-contains:
#    - 'Horse'

  # You can include your own words in generators to be used by all word games that define it.
  # They don't need to be real animals, they're just words to include for organization.
#  include:
#    - 'Duck'

  # If you think one of the generators creates harder or easier words than the others,
  # you can add a modifier here that gets added to the points calculated.
  # You can use a negative number to subtract points, but it prevents the result being
  # less than 1 point.
#  points-modifier: -1

biome: {} # Remove the {} if uncommenting the below!
  # Some biomes can be challenging, so this gives a bit of an extra reward!
  # It does mean that some words get valued higher though, such as easy ones like "River".
